```python
# This is a custom Python code for protein-level analysis of Dengue virus sequences
# It calculates Shannon entropy, consensus residues, residue frequencies, and conservation scores
1.STANDARD_AA, EXCLUDED, GAP constants:
        You explicitly define which residues to include/exclude.Particularly, filtering out 'X' and '-' is tailored to the  dengue protein MSA.
2.Filtering column residues before entropy calculation:
          filtered = [res for res in column if res != GAP and res not in EXCLUDED]
